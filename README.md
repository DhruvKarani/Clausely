📚 What is Clausely?

**Clausely** is an AI-powered tool that helps users intelligently analyze legal documents.  
It extracts clauses, classifies them using ML/NLP models, summarizes the document’s intent, and even provides an integrated chatbot for real-time legal Q&A.

- 🔍 **Extract and identify legal clauses** with precision
- 🧠 **Classify clauses** (e.g., confidentiality, indemnity, dispute resolution) using ML or LegalBERT
- 🪄 **Summarize** the core legal intent in plain English
- 📜 **OCR** scanned documents and handwritten text using Tesseract
- 💬 **Chat with the document** — ask things like:
  - “Is there a termination clause?”
  - “Who bears the liability?”
  - “Is there any mention of arbitration?”

Whether you're a legal practitioner, startup founder, or student — this tool helps you decode legal jargon with ease.
